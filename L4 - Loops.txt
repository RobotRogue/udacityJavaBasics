###L4 Loops

#Loop Types:
There are 3 loop types in Java:

1) While loop - A while loop statement in Java programming language repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a given condition is true.
  while(Boolean_expression) {
     // Statements
  }

2) For loop - A for loop is a repetition control structure that allows you to efficiently write a loop that needs to be executed a specific number of times.
  for(initialization; Boolean_expression; update) {
     // Statements
  }

3) Do-While loop - A do...while loop is similar to a while loop, except that a do...while loop is guaranteed to execute at least one time.
  do {
     // Statements
  }while(Boolean_expression);


#Alarm
Say you wanted to create an alarm that continues to go off until it is stopped.

Here are some functions that help that happen:

  public void beep () {
    // Makes a single beep sound
  }

  public boolean checkAlarm () {
    // Returns true if the alarm is on, false if it is off
  }

  public void alarm () {
    // Keep beeping until it is snoozed
    boolean on = checkAlarm();
    if (on) {
      beep();
      on = checkAlarm(); // but this only runs once... how do we get it to continually check?
    }
  }

In this case we can use a while loop. ;)


#While Loops
while loops allow you to repeat an if condition over and over for as long as that condition remains true, hence the name while!

To create a while loop, simply follow the same steps like an if condition, but replace the if with a while to look something like this:

  while(isRaining){
     System.out.println("It's still raining outside!");
     isRaining = checkWeather();
  }
  System.out.println("Now it's not raining anymore");

This code block above will continue to print the message "It's still raining outside!" for
as long as the boolean isRaining is true, once the function checkWeather() returns false
isRaining will no longer be true, so the while loop would end and the message "Now it's not raining anymore" will be displayed.

Unlike if blocks however, while loops don't have else blocks, they are simply like a repeated if block that would only end when the condition becomes false.


#Quiz - Googol
Can you write a while loop that would print out a googol? (1 with 100 zeroes behind it?)

  String googol = "1"; // Creates a string variable.
  int len = googol.length(); // Creates a length of string variable.

  while (len < 101) { // While length of string is less than 101... do what is in codeblock.
    googol = googol + "0"; // Adds a "0" to the end of the string.
    len = googol.length(); // Reads the length of the new string, and passes that value to the loop.
  }


#Yahtzee! - It's a Match!
The problem we are trying to solve is to count the number of times we need to roll 5 dice to get a Yahtzee.
Instead we should first simplify the problem down to rolling two dice and going from there.

So to simplify, start with writing code that will roll two dice and compare if they are equal or not.
Once you have that code, you can then add more dice to the code, to solve the end problem.

Here is code for rolling two dice:

  public int keeprolling () {
    int dice1 = rollDice();
    int dice2 = rollDice();
    int count = 1;

    while (!(dice1 == dice2)) {
      // We need to re-roll
      dice1 = rollDice();
      dice2 = rollDice();
      count = count + 1;
    }
    return count;
  }
