###L1: Variables and Data Types

#Variables - java variables have a name and a value (the name is immutable, the value can change)

Java varaibles have to have an assigned type. Such as INT or STRING, etc. This cannot be changed.

To declare a variable, you can type the following:

  int passengers;

To initialize (set a value for) the variable, type in:

  passengers = 0;

To update the variable (since its initially 0 in this case...), you would:

  passengers = passengers + 5

#Displaying Variables - a way of displaying the value stored inside a variable

One way is to print a line to the console, so using the example variable above,
it would look like this:

  System.out.println(passengers);

#String Variables - can contain on or many characters (and, its even indexed!)

The syntax would look like this:

  String driver;

And to initialize:

  driver = "Hamish";

Want to know how many letters are in that string? Use this!

  int letters = driver.length();
  System.out.println(letters);

Want to update every char in the strin to uppercase? Use this!

  String driver;
  driver = "Hamish";
  driver = driver.toUpperCase();
  System.out.println(driver);

#String Concatenation - Joining strings together to build a longer string.

Here's an example of string concatenation:

  String driverFirstName;
  driverFirstName = "Hamish";
  String driverLastName;
  driverLastName = "Blake";
  String driverFullName = driverFirstName + driverLastName;
  System.out.println(driverFullName);

The above code is concatenated, not formatted in a friendly way. If you want to do the same, but make it readable (with like, a space in between f/l name) do this:

  String driverFirstName;
  driverFirstName = "Hamish";
  String driverLastName;
  driverLastName = "Blake";
  String driverFullName = driverFirstName + " " + driverLastName;
  System.out.println(driverFullName);

You can also do that to integer values:

  int stops;
  int fare;
  stops = 0;
  fare = 0;
  stops = stops + 1;
  fare = fare + 5;
  System.out.println("The bus made $" + fare + " after " + stops + "stops.");

#String Quiz - What would this output?

  String language = "java";
  String feeling = "Love";
  feeling = feeling.toLowerCase();
  language = language.toUpperCase();
  System.out.println("I " + feeling + " " + language);

Answer: I love JAVA

#Variable Names - rules and regulations

  String driverFirstName;
  driverFirstName = "Hamish";

When creating a variable name, always follow the lower camel case, like the variable name above.

Variable name rules:
Try to always use full words and not abbreviations.
Variable names are case sensitive.
Start your variable names with a letter.
You can start with $ or _ but its not advised.
You cannot have spaces in variable names.

Oh, and the way we were declaring and initializing variables separately above? You can do it all at once, to save typing and codespace, like this:

  String player = "Jack";
  int stockPrice = 100;

And so on...

#Data Types - More than just int and String...

int is limited to 10 digits.
Long is limited to 10 digits * 10000000
Double can store data types with decimal places

String - we know this one
char - stores a single character only, ie: char answer = 'b'; (Note: This uses single quote only!!)

boolean - stores true or false, thats it.

Just google "Java Data Types" for more about this. There's a lot. These are the main ones tho.

#Variable Arithmetic - Doing math with code

Here are some various examples:

  int x = 2+3;
  int y = 4-5;
  int temp = -20;
  int days = 7*4;
  double div = 5/2

Now, there is truncation if you divide numbers and it results in a fraction, if the data type is not double, then it will truncate the remainder in the division.
This is not always a bad thing, there are times where you want this to happen.

#Casting - To turn an int value into a double:

  int x = 5;
  int y = 2;
  double div = x/y;
  System.out.println(div); //would output 2
  double.accurate = (double)x/y;
  System.out.println(accurate); //would output 2.5


#Comments! - Best practices when coding

The standard java (and javascript!) syntax for commenting is:

  // single line comment

  /*
  Multi
  Line
  Comment
  */

It's good practice to explain what functionality does via commenting, especially when other people read your code.


#Quiz - The 5th Subject (Calculate the average grade)

- The average grade is the total sum of grades divided by the number of subjects graded.
- Your friend only knows 4 of 5 grades so far.
- So in this case, you would just add the 4 grades together, then divide that sum by 4

Here's the approach:

  double maths = 97.5;
  double english = 98;
  double science = 83.5;
  double drama = 75;
  double sum = maths + english + science + drama;
  double average = sum / 4;
  System.out.println(average);

  (results in 88.5)

Now - lets try to figure this out once he knows his final grade:

  /* Your friend seems to be really good at music,
  he managed to score 96% on his final exam!
  Now that you know all 5 subject grades,
  update the average calculation below to calculate the
  total average of all subjects. */

  double maths=97.5;
  double english=98;
  double science=83.5;
  double drama=75;
  double music = 96;
  double sum=maths+english+science+drama+music;
  int numOfSubjects = 5;
  double average=sum/numOfSubjects;
  System.out.println(average);

#Quiz - Track the Values

What will the output be?

  int x = 0;
  int y = 4;
  double z = 3;
  x = x + 2;
  z = x + y - 7;
  y = x * 3;
  System.out.println("x = "+x); // 2
  System.out.println("y = "+y); // 6
  System.out.println("z = "+z); // -1.0


#L1 Project:

Q1: Which has an error?
A) int x = 5;
B) double temp = 75.6;
C) char grade = 'A';
D) String name = 'Adam';

My Answer: D (Adam should be in " ") -- correct

Q2:
What value for register will be displayed for the below code?
  double register = 10.0;
  register = register + 5;
  register = register - 2.5;
  register = register + 10;
  register = register - 3;
  System.out.println(register);

My Answer: 19.5 -- correct

Q3: Define an integer var called bankBalance. Init it to a value of 500. Add 250 to it. Subtract 100 from it. Print it.

My Answer:
  int bankBalance
  bankBalance = 500;
  bankBalance = bankBalance + 250;
  bankBalance = bankBalance - 100;
  System.out.println(bankBalance);

Q4: What value will result from: System.out.println(2.0 * (5 / 2));

My Answer: 5.0 -- wrong.
Correct answer: 4.
When evaluating the arithmetic expression 2.0 * (5 / 2), Java will evaluate the expression inside the parentheses, 5 / 2.
When dividing two integers, Java will take ignore the remainder, so 5 / 2 evaluates to the integer 2, not the double 2.5.
This process is called truncation. The second step in evaluating the expression is evaluating 2.0 * 2.
When multiplying a double and an integer, the result is a double, so the value printed is the double 4.0.

Q5: Write Java code to define an integer variable called day, and a String variable called month.
Give month and day appropriate values for your birthday.

  int day = 2;
  String month = "March"

Q6: Write Java code to create a String variable called firstName, define it to be your first name as a String.
Then define a variable called lastName and define it to be your last name as a String.
Then define a variable called fullName and set it to be your first name followed by a space followed by your last name.
Use the existing variables for your first and last name and String concatenation to define fullName.
Finally, write code to print this text:

  Hello, my name is [full name].
  There are [number] letters in my name.

Use String concatenation to create the first String to print using the fullName variable, and use the .length() command on
firstName and lastName to calculate the number of letters.

Note: you can concatenate an integer and a String and the integer will be converted to a String. For example, this expression:

"There are "+ 7 + "days in a week."

will be evaluated as the String:

"There are 7 days in a week."

My Answer:
  String firstName = "Nelson";
  String lastName = "Gill";
  String fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
  System.out.println("Hello, my name is " + fullName);
  System.out.println("There are " + (firstName.length()+lastName.length()) + " letters in my name.")

Example solution code:
  String firstName = "Asser";
  String lastName = "Samak";
  String fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
  System.out.println("Hello, my name is " + fullName + ".");
  int lettersInName = firstName.length() + lastName.length();
  System.out.println("There are " + lettersInName
  + " letters in my name.");

Q7: Write Java code to define a double variable called fahrenheit and set it to an initial value between 0 and 100.
Then, create a double variable called celsius, and calculate its value based on the value of fahrenheit.
(To convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius, subtract 32, then multiply by 5, then divide by 9.)
Finally, print the final value of celsius.

  double farenheit = 32.5;
  double celsius = (farenheit - 32) * 5 / 9;
  System.out.println(celsius);
