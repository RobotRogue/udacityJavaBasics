Hello notes!

###L1: Variables and Data Types

#Variables - java variables have a name and a value (the name is immutable, the value can change)

Java varaibles have to have an assigned type. Such as INT or STRING, etc. This cannot be changed.

To declare a variable, you can type the following:

  int passengers;

To initialize (set a value for) the variable, type in:

  passengers = 0;

To update the variable (since its initially 0 in this case...), you would:

  passengers = passengers + 5

#Displaying Variables - a way of displaying the value stored inside a variable

One way is to print a line to the console, so using the example variable above,
it would look like this:

  System.out.println(passengers);

#String Variables - can contain on or many characters (and, its even indexed!)

The syntax would look like this:

  String driver;

And to initialize:

  driver = "Hamish";

Want to know how many letters are in that string? Use this!

  int letters = driver.length();
  System.out.println(letters);

Want to update every char in the strin to uppercase? Use this!

  String driver;
  driver = "Hamish";
  driver = driver.toUpperCase();
  System.out.println(driver);

#String Concatenation - Joining strings together to build a longer string.

Here's an example of string concatenation:

  String driverFirstName;
  driverFirstName = "Hamish";
  String driverLastName;
  driverLastName = "Blake";
  String driverFullName = driverFirstName + driverLastName;
  System.out.println(driverFullName);
