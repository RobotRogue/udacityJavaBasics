#L1: Variables and Data Types

Variables - java variables have a name and a value (the name is immutable, the value can change)

Java varaibles have to have an assigned type. Such as INT or STRING, etc. This cannot be changed.

To declare a variable, you can type the following:

  int passengers;

To initialize (set a value for) the variable, type in:

  passengers = 0;

To update the variable (since its initially 0 in this case...), you would:

  passengers = passengers + 5
