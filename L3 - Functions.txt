Hello notes! https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud282/lessons/8192650550/concepts/38f71cca-9f97-4fbd-baee-7c39914b9376

###L3 Functions

#What is a function? (aka: method)
A Function lets you create code so it can be reused or used by other classes and so on.

#Function Definition - Contains the code that a function executes.

#Function Call - Executing the code in the function definition.

#Function Definition Example + Syntax:
Let's write a function (definition) to print the chorus for 'Heart of Glass':

  public void chorus () {
    System.out.println("Once I had a love and it was a gas");
    System.out.println("Soon turned out had a heart of glass");
    System.out.println("Seemed like the real thing, only to find");
    System.out.println("Mucho mistrust, love's gone behind");
  }

public = access modifier - anyone can access this function. (more later)
void = return type - means it doesn't return a value.
chorus = function name - when you call the function, you call it by this name.
the () after chorus = where any parameters are made to be passed into the function.
the {} = the codeblock of the function

#Function Call Example:
To call the function we created above, we simply have to type this:

  chorus();


#Quiz - Play Music
Define a function called playMusic() that prints out:
We're given a boolean playButton;
"Music is playing" (when playButton = true)
"Music is paused" (when playButton is false)

My Answer:
  public void playMusic () {
      if (playButton) {
          System.out.println("Music is playing");
      } else {
          System.out.println("Music is paused");
      }
  }


#Parameters and Arguments
Earlier when we saw a function definition - after the function name we saw the empty () - this is
where we would define parameters.

Parameters are essentially variables that we can pass into the function for use by the funciton.

Example:

  public void greeting (String location) {
    System.out.println("Hello " + location);
  }

In the above case, wne you call the function, you would assign a value to the location variable so
that the function can use it, like this:

  greeting("New York");

Would output the following:

  Hello New York

#Quiz - Weather Arguments

Given this code...

  public void weatherInterpreter (int temperature) {
    if (temperature > 30) {
      System.out.println("It's hot outside!");
    } else if (temperature < 5) {
      System.out.println("Brr, consider wearing a jacket.");
    } else {
      System.out.println("Not too hot, not too cold.");
    }
  }

What will output for the following calls?

  weatherInterpreter(4);
  weatherInterpreter(32);

My Answer:
Brr, consider wearing a jacket. -- correct
It's hot outside! -- correct


#Variable Temperature
When we call the funciton, instead of passing in a direct int value, we can pass in variables too, like this:

  int degreesC = 15;

  weatherInterpreter(degreesC)

Notice, we defined the variable degreesC, and set a value of 15.
Then we called the function, and passed in the parameter of the variable degreesC.
It took that, checked the value of the variable, and because it was an int, used the value and ran the function.

#Quiz - Rollercoaster Parameter

This function checks eligibility to ride a rollercoaster, and requires that a person input their height in cm.
'admission(130.5)' is a valid call. Fill in the parameter to complete it with valid data.

  public void admission (double height) {
    if (height > 120) {
      System.out.println("Ur good to ride");
    } else {
      System.out.println("Get taller shorty");
    }
  }


#Multiple Parameters
Let's make a function for printing that takes in height and width, and a boolean for color.

  public void printPhoto (int width, int height, boolean inColor) {
    System.out.println("Width = " + width + " cm");
    System.out.println("Height = " + height + " cm");
    if (inColor) {
      System.out.println("Print is full color.");
    } else {
      System.out.println("Print is black and white");
    }
  }

And to call this function:

  printPhoto(30, 40, true);

HOWEVER! The ORDER of the parameters is very important - because we have to define data types for the
parameters, so if you call them in the wrong order, it might mismatch the data type and error out.


#Argument Order
Taking the above code, what happens if you call the same function, but get the parameters in the wrong order?

  printPhoto(10, 20, false); -- this will work just fine.
  printPhoto(20, 10, false); -- this will make the photo look weird.
  printPhoto(20, false, 10); -- this will error out (because 2 of the types mismatch)


#Quiz - Liking Photos
Write a function call for the function likePhoto:

  public void likePhoto (int currentLikes, String comment, boolean like) {
    System.out.println("Feedback: " + comment);
    if (like) {
      currentLikes = currentLikes + 1;
    }
    System.out.println("Number of likes: " + currentLikes);
  }

My Answer: likePhoto(5, "Nice pic!", true); -- corrent


#Return Values
Functions can take in data via parameters, but they can also return a value as well.

The syntax for a function that does return a value is:

  public String functionName () {
    return;
  }

Basically, we specify what the data type of the return will be - which makes the function return something.

Here's an example:

  public int likePhoto (int currentLikes, String comment, boolean like) {
    System.out.println("Feedback: " + comment);
    if (like) {
      currentLikes = currentLikes + 1;
    }
    System.out.println("Number of likes: " + currentLikes);
    return currentLikes;
  }

So we can now consume the currentLikes value outside of the function, and we can even assign that return to a new
varable value - kind of like this:

  int returnedLikes = likePhoto(0, "Good stuff", true);

The above would call the likePhoto function, pass it some parameters, and the output would be stored in returnedLikes.

Thast would be handy since you can then pass that back into the function as a parameter so it will keep track of the
returnedLikes value autmatically... like this:

  likePhoto(returnedLikes, "I like this", true);

So that's calling the likePhoto function, passing it a int variable of returnedLikes, a comment, and a boolean.
Then the function uses the returnedLikes value to store the currentLikes and increase when needed.

Kind of confusing, but that's programming right?

TODO: Revisit the "Return Photo Likes" section again.


#Quiz - What's Missing?
This code won't return the string we want. Can you identify whats wrong with this code?

  public void admission (double height) {
    String passText;
    // checks height requirements
    if (height > 120) {
      passText = "You pass.";
    } else {
      passText = "You too short.";
    }
    return passText;
  }

a) passText isn't a string?
b) Wrong return type?
c) Wrong return statement?
d) Nothing is wrong?

My Answer: b) Wrong return type (void won't return anything) -- correct

#Quiz - Making change
This program should calculate the correct change.
The change is the difference of the money paid vs the item cost.

Write a function that returns the correct change:
(Remember to return a value you need 1) a return type and 2) a return statement)

My Answer:

  public double makeChange (double itemCost, double dollarsProvided) {
    double change = dollarsProvided - itemCost;
    return change;
  }


#Random Numbers:
Lets write a function that gives us a random number, using the Math.random(); builtin function.
Quick note, Math.random returns a range of decimal numbers from 0 to 0.999... etc.

Let's break down some code here:

  double randomNumber = Math.random() * 10; // the * 10 makes the fractional number more readable.

  int randomInt = (int) randomNumber; // Using "casting" to change that double into an int.
  // (Casting is turning one variable type into another)


#Rolling Dice
So now that we know how to get random numbers, and convert them into whole (int) numbers from 0-9,
this gives us some of the tools we need to make a 'dice roll' function.

  public int rollDice () {
    double randomNumber = Math.random() * 6; // this gives us a range of 0-5.9999
    randomNumber = randomNumber + 1; // this changes the range to 1-6.99999 (1-6)
    int randomInt = (int) randomNumber; // this changes the double value to an int
    return randomInt;
  }

Let's call this to test it, and let's also store the output into a new variable (for giggles)

  int roll1 = rollDice();
  int roll2 = rollDice();

And let's see what that resulted in:

  System.out.println("First roll was " + roll1 + " and the second roll was " + roll2);


#Quiz - Improved Dice Roll
Can this function work for 8 or 10-sided dice?

  public int rollDice () {
    double randomNumber = Math.random() * 6;
    randomNumber = randomNumber + 1;
    int randomInt = (int) randomNumber;
    return randomInt;
  }

My Answer: (It was basically correct except for my notes)

  public int rollDice (int sides) { // Remember to specify the data type of the parameter!!
    double randomNumber = Math.random() * sides;
    randomNumber = randomNumber + 1;
    int randomInt = (int) randomNumber;
    return randomInt;
  }


#Java Documentation
Lets you find out about built-in functions and how to use them.
This includes: function descriptions, variable types, how to use... etc.
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/package-summary.html


#Quiz - Read this doc!
What will the function call "Math.max(20, 15);" output?
Fill in the data type, and the specific falue the function call would output.

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html#max-int-int-

a) int
b) 20


#Importance of Documentation - Using Comments!

Generally you want to describe the function in the same way as on the Oracle Java Docs
Explain the inputs, data types, roughyl what the function does, what it returns,  syntax and use.

Here's an example of a pretty good comment:

  /**
   * General description of the function
   *
   * @param a first input parameter, named a
   * @param b second parameter, named b
   *
   * @return description of returned value (if applicable)
   */

Here's an example using our rollDice function we made:

  /**
   * This dice function simulates a random dice roll
   * for a dice with a given number of sides
   *
   * @param sides - the number of sides of the dice you want to roll
   *
   * @return a random number within the range of the sides, as an int
   */


#Quiz - Complete this doc
Here is the Java doc comment that produces the incomplete document shown above:

    /*
    * Returns the absolute value of an int value.
    * If the argument is not negative, the argument
    * is returned. If the argument is negative, the negation of the argument is returned.
    *
    * @param a - the argument whose absolute value is to be determined
    *
    * @return the absolute value of the argument.
    */


#L3 Project:

Q1) In the function signature below, what is the return type?

  public float squareRoot(int x)

A. public
B. float -- my answer (correct)
C. squareRoot
D. int

Q2) Write the signature of a function called isPrime().
The access modifier should be public, the return type should be boolean, and it should take a single integer parameter.

My Answer: (correct)
  public boolean isPrime (int checkMe) {
    // Stuff
  }

Q3) Which of the following function signatures has an error?

A. public getAccountBalanace(long accountNumber)
B. public void displayInTextBox(String string)
C. public int roundToNearestInt(double x)
D. public double getTemperature()

My Answer: A (missing the return type) -- correct

Q4) Write a Java function called absoluteValue().
The access modifier should be public, it should have a return type of double,
and it should take one double parameter as input. If the double parameter is less than 0,
it should return that number negated. Otherwise, it should return the parameter unchanged.

  public double absoluteValue (double x) {
    if (x < 0) {
      x = x * -1; // not needed
      return x; // just return -x
    } else {
      return x;
    }
  }

(I got most of it except for the commented areas)

Q5) Write a Java function named calculateTip().
The access modifier should be public, it should have a return type of double,
and it should take as input a double parameter representing the cost of a meal at a restaurant.
And finally, it should return a double equal to 15% of the cost parameter

  public double calculateTip (double mealCost) {
    return mealCost * 0.15;
  }

Mine was wrong... the solution is:

  public double calculateTip (double mealCost) {
    double tip = mealCost * 0.15;
    return tip;
  }

Q6) Write a Java function called nametagText().
The access modifier should be public, the return type should be String,
and it should take a String parameter called name.
In the body of the function, return the String “Hello, my name is ” with
the name parameter added to the end. (Hint: use String concatenation.)

  public String nametagText(String name) {
    String greeting = ("Hello, my name is " + name);
    return greeting;
  }

Their solution:

  public String nametagText(String name) {
    String nametagText = ("Hello, my name is " + name);
    return nametagText;
  }

Q7) Define two functions. The first should be called fahrenheitToCelsius().
It should be a public function with return type double that takes a double argument that
represents a temperature in Fahrenheit degrees.
It should return the equivalent temperature in Celsius degrees.
(To convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius, use the formula C = (F − 32) × 5/9.)

Next, define a function called printTemperature(). It should be public, it should have a
return type of void, and it should take a double parameter that represents a temperature in
Fahrenheit degrees.
This function should print “F: ” followed by the Fahrenheit parameter, then “C: ” followed by
the equivalent value in Celsius degrees. Use the first function you defined to calculate the
appropriate Celsius value inside the second function.

Bonus challenge: write javadoc comments for both functions.

My Answer:

  // double tempInFarenheit = 64.5;

  public double farenheitToCelsius (double tempInFarenheit) {
    double tempInCelsius = (tempInFarenheit - 32) * 5/9;
    return tempInCelsius;
  }

  public void printTemperature (double tempInCelsius) {
    System.out.println("F: " + tempInFarenheit + "C: " + tempInCelsius);
  }

Their Solution:

  public double fahrenheitToCelsius(double fahrenheit) {
    return (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9;
  }

  public void printTemperature(double fahrenheit) {
    System.out.println("F: " + fahrenheit);
    System.out.println("C: " + fahrenheitToCelsius(fahrenheit));
  }

In line 464, you specify the F value in the parameter
So in line 466, they called the fToC method and passed in the farenheit value (that was passed in, in the parameter)

Q8) Define a function called monopolyRoll().
This function provides a random result based on the dice-rolling rules for the board game Monopoly.
In Monopoly, players roll two six-sided dice to determine their move.
If they roll the same value on both dice, this is called “rolling doubles,” and it means they go again.
In our simplified version, the dice-roll function should behave like this:

  1. Generate two random integers in the 1 to 6 range.
  2. If the numbers are not the same, return the sum.
  3. If the numbers are the same, generate two more random integers in the 1 to 6 range, and return the sum of all 4 numbers.

Hint: to make your code neater, you can define a second function that generates a random integer in the 1 to 6 range
(or in the 1 to x range based on a parameter) so that you do not need to keep repeating that code.

public int randomRoll() {
  double randomNumber = Math.random() * 6;
  randomNumber = randomNumber + 1;
  int randomInt = (int) randomNumber;
  return randomInt;
}

public int monopolyRoll() {
  int roll1 = randomRoll();
  int roll2 = randomRoll();

  if (roll1 != roll2) {
    return roll1 + roll2;
  } else {
    int roll3 = randomRoll();
    int roll4 = randomRoll();
    return roll1 + roll2 + roll3 + roll4;
  }
}


Example solution code:
  /**
  * Returns a random integer simulating a dice roll.
  * @param sides Number of sides on the virtual die being rolled.
  * @return random number in the range of 1 to sides.
  */

  public int diceRoll(int sides) {
    double randomNumber = Math.random() * sides;
    randomNumber = randomNumber + 1;
    return (int) randomNumber;
  }

  public int monopolyRoll() {
    int roll1 = diceRoll(6);
    int roll2 = diceRoll(6);
    int total = roll1 + roll2;

    if (roll1 == roll2) {
      int roll3 = diceRoll(6);
      int roll4 = diceRoll(6);
      total = total + roll3 + roll4;
    }
    return total;
  }

Mine is actually correct, mine is just the long-form way of doing the same as their solution.

And that's that.
